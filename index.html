      <h2>1986: Pixar</h2>
      <p> Pixar Animation Studios originally started in 1979 as part of a Computer Division of Lucasfilm. While still part of Lucasfilm, it was originally named the
        "Graphics Group" before the name was changed. The origin behind the name Pixar comes from a made up Spanish word that means "to make pictures". It was created by
        Aly Ray, Loren Carpenter, and Rodney Stock. In 1986, it was acquired by Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. Years later Pixar Animation Studios become part of the Walt
        Disney Company in 2006. The final price to buy Pixar was a whopping $7.4 billion.</p>
      <p> Although Pixar had been around for a while, their first big break happened in 1996. A decade after being bought
        by Steve Jobs, Pixar Animation Studios released the very first completely computer animated movie: <b>Toy Story</b>.
        Starting off with a budget of $30 million to create the film, Pixar had no idea how big of a success this movie would be.
        Over $361 million was made off of this first movie worldwide. Still, they had no idea that this movies series would become
        one of the most known in our generation today.</p>

      <h2>1995: Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)</h2>
      <p> The Digital Versatile Disc is considered the second generation of the compact disc technology. After the Sony Cooperation and
         Phillips put out the first audio compact disc (CD), research began to create the same amount of quality storage on a disc of the
         same size. This time however, the disc would be designed to hold videos. In 1994 two different kinds of discs were created: the Multimedia CD and the Super Density disc.
        The competing companies were Sony and Phillips vs. the Toshiba Corporation and Time Warner Inc. By the end of the next year,
        the two groups agreed on a combination of both formats, and they finally produced the DVD. It was first released in Japan in 1996 for sale.</p>

      <h2>1998: iMac</h2>
      <p> The iMac was first introduced by Apple’s co-founder and CEO the late Steve Jobs. Jobs claimed that it was designed for the
        number one use. Consumers tell them what they want a computer for, which is to get on the Internet, simply and fast. This is exactly
        what an iMac was designed for. The iMac was first released on 15 August 1998 for the price of $1,299. It quickly became the best-selling
        Macintosh desktop that Christmas. The original iMac introduced USB to the computer world as the first Macintosh computer to feature a USB port.
        It also killed off the floppy drive, a way of backing up information from your computer.</p>
        <p> Apple’s original iMac design came in a variety of colors: Bondi Blue, then Lime, Strawberry, Blueberry, Grape, Tangerine,
        and later Blue Dalmatian and Flower Power. The 'i' in iMac stands for internet and was Apple's first 'i' product. Apple adopted the 'i' prefix across much of its consumer lines,
         including iPod, iPhone, iPad, iLife, iWork and iTunes. </p>

    <div class="fourth">
      <h2>2003: iTunes</h2>
      <p> On April 28, 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes Store. Apple’s idea was simple: to provide a virtual store where people can buy and
        download digital music on-demand to listen to on the go. Initially, the store only hosted 200,000 tracks, and only Mac users were able
        to buy and transfer music to their iPod. However, PC users had to wait until October of 2003 for the release of the Windows version of iTunes.
        It was no surprise that 18 hours after the service first went live, it had sold approximately 275,000 tracks. It even sold 70 million songs in
        its first year. Today, the iTunes Store is the largest seller of digital music in the United States. They have sold over 10 billion songs since
        it was created. So many people around the world use iTunes daily to listen to anything from music to podcasts. It was a great advance in technology. </p>

      <h2>2010: iPad</h2>
      <p> The first generation of iPads were introduced in 2010 as a new revolutionary device. A lot of people doubted that Apple would be able to make a good profit off this new release,
        but they were able to sell over 3 million iPads in 80 days. It came in either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB storage capacities at first , while
        also promising a 10-hour battery life. The pricing started at $499, and there were accessories including a keyboard docking station, as well as a standard
        docking station to turn the iPad into a "great photo frame". The iPad was compatible with nearly all existing iPhone apps at the time. Those
        iPhone apps were able to run in two modes: in a window about the size of an iPhone screen or scaled-up to fullscreen mode. The original iPad
        debuted as a Wi-Fi-only device. Shortly after the initial launch, though, Apple debuted a Wi-Fi/3G model that offered offer full Assisted GPS. Now there
      are multiple versions of this item, and many people still use them today for countless reasons.  </p>
