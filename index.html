      <h2>1986: Pixar</h2>
      <p> Pixar Animation Studios originally started in 1979 as part of a Computer Division of Lucasfilm. While still part of Lucasfilm, it was originally named the
        "Graphics Group" before the name was changed. The origin behind the name Pixar comes from a made up Spanish word that means "to make pictures". It was created by
        Aly Ray, Loren Carpenter, and Rodney Stock. In 1986, it was acquired by Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. Years later Pixar Animation Studios become part of the Walt
        Disney Company in 2006. The final price to buy Pixar was a whopping $7.4 billion.</p>
      <p> Although Pixar had been around for a while, their first big break happened in 1996. A decade after being bought
        by Steve Jobs, Pixar Animation Studios released the very first completely computer animated movie: <b>Toy Story</b>.
        Starting off with a budget of $30 million to create the film, Pixar had no idea how big of a success this movie would be.
        Over $361 million was made off of this first movie worldwide. Still, they had no idea that this movies series would become
        one of the most known in our generation today.</p>

      <h2>1995: Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)</h2>
      <p> The Digital Versatile Disc is considered the second generation of the compact disc technology. After the Sony Cooperation and
         Phillips put out the first audio compact disc (CD), research began to create the same amount of quality storage on a disc of the
         same size. This time however, the disc would be designed to hold videos. In 1994 two different kinds of discs were created: the Multimedia CD and the Super Density disc.
        The competing companies were Sony and Phillips vs. the Toshiba Corporation and Time Warner Inc. By the end of the next year,
        the two groups agreed on a combination of both formats, and they finally produced the DVD. It was first released in Japan in 1996 for sale.</p>
